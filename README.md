# Citadel

A declarative CDK deployment framework for AWS ECS/Fargate.

## Overview

Citadel makes container deployments as simple as the Serverless Framework experience — but targeting ECS/Fargate instead of Lambda. You declare your app once in a `citadel.yml`. The tool handles SSM secret syncing, CDK infrastructure deployment, Docker build/push, and ECS service rollout in a single command.

```bash
citadel deploy --env dev --deploy-infra
```

## The Problem

Deploying ECS applications involves managing configuration across multiple files:
- Secret lists in deployment scripts
- Duplicate secret definitions in CDK code
- Infrastructure config scattered across multiple files

When you add a new secret (e.g. `INSTAGRAM_APP_ID`), you must update multiple places manually. Miss one and the ECS task fails with cryptic errors, potentially leaving your CloudFormation stack in `UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED` state.

## The Solution

**Single source of truth:** `citadel.yml` defines everything about your deployment.

Both the CLI tool and CDK constructs read from the same file. Write a secret name once, use it everywhere.

## Installation

```bash
# Go
go install github.com/ClusterBox/citadel/cmd/citadel@latest

# From source
git clone https://github.com/ClusterBox/citadel.git
cd citadel
make install
```

## Usage

### Full deployment pipeline

```bash
citadel deploy --env dev --deploy-infra
```
